a. JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) provides way for JavaScript to interact with and modify the content of a web page.
  The DOM also represents an HTML document in memory.

b.JavaScript Promises are guarantees for actions that will happen in the future.In JavaScript, a Promise works similarly.
 It's an object that represents an asynchronous operation. A promise can have two outcomes;
 When the operation succeeds, the Promise is "fulfilled" with the result you expected.
 When something goes wrong, the Promise is "rejected" with an error explaining what happened.

c. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of organizing and writing code that models real-world objects and their interactions.
Imagine you are building a simulation, and you have different characters in the game, like a hero, a monster, and a treasure chest.
In OOP, each of these characters would be represented as an "object" with its own unique characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

d. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later point in time or after a specific event occurs.
  Callbacks are used to handle asynchronous operations or to execute code after some task is completed.
